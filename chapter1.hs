-- Chapter 1 of A Structure and Interpretations of Computer Programs
-- This file contains problem statements, and haskell solutions for selected problems.

-- Notes on compiling the file: Like the Scheme workflow for SICP, this file does not need to
-- be compiled... rather, just import the function definitions into the Haskell interpreter (ghci)
-- to test your functions.
--
-- To do this, run [:l filename.hs] in the ghci shell in the directory housing your code.

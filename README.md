#Haskell-SICP#

[A Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) by Harold Abelson and Gerald Sussman is  one of the best books on functional programming and  computer science logic. I was exposed to this book in my high school [AP Computer Science class](http://paleyontology.com/AP_CS/), and through the course of the school year, I gained an appreciation and understanding for both Scheme, as well as for the structured logic necessary to be a computer programmer. 

I am revisiting SICP with Haskell now, to both learn the Haskell programming language, as well as to reintroduce myself to functional programming concepts.

##Structure of Repository##
I will be going over a subset of the exercises in A Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs defined by my Computer Science teacher Mr. Paley in his AP Computer Science Class, with a few additional interesting exercises here and there. 

The selected exercises can be found [here](http://paleyontology.com/AP_CS/):

There will be a haskell script for each chapter of SICP, with comments denoting the problem statement, and the problem numbers.

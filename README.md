#Haskell-SICP#

[A Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) by Harold Abelson and Gerald Sussman is hands-down one of the best books on functional programming and more importantly, computer science logic ever written. I was exposed to this book in my high school [AP Computer Science class](http://paleyontology.com/AP_CS/), and through the course of the school year, I gained an appreciation and understanding for both Scheme, as well as for the structured logic necessary to be a computer programmer. 

I am revisiting SICP now in Haskell, for two reasons.

1. I wish to gain a more in-depth familiarity with Haskell, and I feel SICP is the best way to do so.
2. It has been some time since I have looked through SICP, and going into college, I feel it necessary to sharpen my logic and other thought processes. 

##Structure of Repository##
I will be going over a subset of the exercises in A Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs defined by my Computer Science teacher Mr. Paley in his AP Computer Science Class, with a few additional interesting exercises here and there. 
I can assure you that the selected exercises will cover the breadth of topics introduced in SICP.

The schedule, and selected exercises can be found [here](http://paleyontology.com/AP_CS/):

There will be a haskell script for each chapter of SICP, with comments denoting the problem statement, and the problem numbers.
